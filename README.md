# Introduction to MATLAB

This is a simple list with small introductory exercises to MATLAB: MATrix LABoratory.

# Overview

This repository does not even come close to covering all the commands and functions of MATLAB, and this is not the intent of the repository.

This repository contains the main notes of classes related to the discipline taught by me in the Graduate Program in Computer Engineering of the Universidade Católica de Petrópolis (Catholic University of Petrópolis, UCP) in the year 2013.

For more information on MATLAB, commands and functions, go to: [Mathworks](https://www.mathworks.com "Mathworks.com").

**Notice:**

- It is believed that all the information contained in this repository is correct. However, there is no guarantee.

- All exercises in this repo were implemented in MATLAB (version R2010a) and might not work with other versions.
